Title: Operation Alpine Lockbit – Multi-Stage Manatee Tempest Ransomware Campaign  

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
On June 20, 2024, the Russia-based Manatee Tempest threat actor initiated a coordinated, multi-host campaign against the Alpine Ski House environment. The attack began with a drive-by download (FakeUpdate/SocGholish) via vectorsandarrows.com, delivering a BLISTER loader and Cobalt Strike beacons. The actor executed credential theft (Mimikatz, LSASS memory dumps, Primary Refresh Token access), leveraged WMI and PsExec for lateral movement across five Windows hosts, disabled backup and recovery features (VSSAdmin, bcdedit), and finally deployed LockBit-style ransomware payloads (.lockbit extension) to encrypt critical user data. Multiple Microsoft Defender alerts confirmed each stage, and automated containment actions blocked SMB lateral movement. No evidence of data exfiltration was observed, but asset recovery will require rebuilt systems and password resets.

4. Persistence/Defense Evasion (T1036/T1547.005):  
   – Sysinternals tools renamed (mimikatz.exe, conhost.exe) to evade detection on vnevado-win10v.  
   – Automated disabling of Windows recovery features (vssblatemp.exe, bcdedit.exe) across hosts, deleting shadow copies (T1490).  
5. Lateral Movement (T1021; T1021.002; T1021.006):  
   – PsExec from vnevado-win10v to vnevado-jump.  
   – SMB file operations blocked by Microsoft 365 Defender on win11t.  
6. Collection (T1039): “Possible ransomware activity based on a known malicious extension” on win11u and win11t, observing mass file changes and .lockbit extension rhombus.  
7. Impact (T1486): Ransomware payloads (kiters.7z.lockbit, syncretic.7z.lockbit, ponceau.7z.lockbit, characterical.zip.lockbit, earlap.doc.lockbit, unstreaming.xlsx.lockbit) dropped and executed, with subsequent ransomware behavior alerts.
