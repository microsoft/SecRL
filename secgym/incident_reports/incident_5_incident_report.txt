Below is a comprehensive technical incident report summarizing a complex, multi‐stage attack observed in the knowledge graph. The investigation reveals that threat actors – consistent with profiles such as Manatee Tempest – used a sequence of techniques including initial network access via drive‐by download and malvertising, credential theft (using Mimikatz), lateral movement (via PSExec and WMI abuse), disruption of backup and recovery (via deletion of snapshots and tampering with boot configuration), and finally the remote launch of a ransomware payload. The multi‐vector attack leverages a mix of known malware tools, abuse of legitimate Windows utilities, and suspicious network communications to disable recovery options and facilitate further compromise.

1. TITLE OF THE MULTI‐STAGE ATTACK
   “Multi‐Stage Lateral Movement, Credential Theft, and Ransomware Deployment by a Manatee Tempest–Associated Actor”

────────────────────────────
2. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
   On or around June 20, 2024, our monitoring systems detected a series of critical alerts that together form the signature of a complex, multi‐stage attack. The adversary – whose behavior is consistent with Russia–based groups tracked as Manatee Tempest – exploited several vectors:
     • Initial access was gained via methods known as malvertising or FakeUpdates (often leveraged by partners such as Mustard Tempest).
     • Once inside, the attacker used widely known tools (for example, Mimikatz) to harvest credentials from LSASS memory, with subsequent lateral movement across multiple endpoints using utilities such as PSExec and suspicious WMI commands.
     • Disabling defensive and recovery mechanisms was an additional key objective. Commands targeting volume shadow copies (via vssblatemp.exe) and boot configuration (using bcdedit.exe) were observed—likely to hamper recovery and enable successful ransomware encryption.
     • Finally, a ransomware payload was launched remotely to encrypt files across compromised systems.
   The incident affected numerous endpoints and high-value user accounts – including those associated with Grace Chen, dp5hn, and tgs2z – placing the organization at significant risk of operational disruption and data loss.

3. INCIDENT TIMELINE

   • June 20, 2024, 08:59–09:07 UTC:
     – Early alerts indicated active execution of the Mimikatz credential theft tool. Command lines such as 
       "mimikatz.exe privilege::debug sekurlsa::logonpasswords exit" were observed.
     – LSASS process memory modifications were detected (alert “LSASS process memory modified”), suggesting an attempt to extract plaintext passwords.
     – Suspicious remote activity was observed on endpoints (via indicators such as remote WMI invocation and anomalous process creation from external IP addresses such as 107.224.99.179 and vectorsandarrows.com).
     – Commands to delete volume shadow copies using vssblatemp.exe and to disable recovery settings with bcdedit.exe were logged. These events signal efforts to block native system recovery.
     
   • June 20, 2024, 09:10–09:32 UTC:
     – Multiple alerts indicated abnormal activity: suspicious WMI process creation, use of PSExec (e.g. “PSExec to Vnevado-jump”) to achieve lateral movement and access jump server infrastructure, and file backup deletions (“File backups were deleted”) across devices.
     – Indicators of compromised accounts (Grace Chen; dp5hn; tgs2z) were reported, with lateral movement alerts showing the attacker moving from one endpoint to another.
     
   • June 20, 2024, 09:32–09:38 UTC:
     – Ransomware-like file system changes were observed. Alerts noting the addition of known “lockbit” file extensions on archive files (e.g. kiters.7z.lockbit and syncretic.7z.lockbit) confirmed potential mass file encryption in progress.
     – Ransomware payloads were reported as remotely launched on affected devices.
     
   • July 04, 2024, 22:35 UTC:
     – A large number of alerts were generated within seconds. These included “Suspicious 'GenRansom' behavior,” “Unknown malware was detected and was active,” and repeated notices of ransomware payloads being launched or file backups being deleted.
     – Repeated alerts from Microsoft Defender ATP and Microsoft 365 Defender confirm that the event spans across both endpoint and extended network monitoring.
     
   • July 10, 2024:
     – An additional alert (“PSExec to Vnevado-jump”) was generated due to observed lateral movement from the jump server, indicating that containment actions (e.g. account disabling, device isolation) may have been triggered.

4. TECHNICAL ANALYSIS

   A. INITIAL COMPROMISE AND RECONNAISSANCE
      – The initial alerts (as seen in the “Manatee Tempest activity group” notifications) describe a threat actor with long–standing activity since 2014 and sanctions imposed by OFAC.
      – The attacker likely leveraged access broker relationships (e.g. Mustard Tempest) to facilitate access into the target network using drive-by techniques such as malvertising or FakeUpdates.

   B. CREDENTIAL THEFT AND LATERAL MOVEMENT
      – Several alerts indicated execution of Mimikatz, a well-known credential-dumping tool. Command lines extracted from process information confirmed invocations of “sekurlsa::pth,” an often-used feature to dump Windows credentials.
      – PsExec activity (an alert “PSExec to Vnevado-jump”) points to the use of legitimate system management tools for lateral movement across endpoints.
      – Suspicious remote activity alerts and multiple WMI process creation events further support that the attacker sought to expand their access from the initially compromised device.

   C. DISRUPTION OF BACKUPS AND SYSTEM RECOVERY
      – Alerts reporting deletion of file backups (“File backups were deleted”) and system recovery setting tampering (involving vssblatemp.exe and bcdedit.exe commands) indicate a deliberate attempt to remove shadow copies and disable recovery options. This tactic is commonly observed in ransomware attacks to ensure that victims cannot quickly restore encrypted data.
      – The use of these commands not only disables recovery features but also may serve to obscure evidence of earlier compromise.

   D. RANSOMWARE PAYLOAD AND FILE ENCRYPTION
      – In the later stages, alerts report ransomware payloads being remotely launched, consistent with human-operated ransomware campaigns. The file-related alerts (e.g., suspicious changes on files with “.lockbit” extensions) indicate that mass encryption may have been underway.
      – Although some alerts (such as “Active unknown malware was detected”) are assigned low severity, the overall convergent technical picture aligns with an attacker preparing for ransomware deployment after credential theft and lateral movement.

   E. ABUSE OF LEGITIMATE UTILITIES
      – The threat actor frequently leveraged native Windows tools—WMIPRVSE.exe, bcdedit.exe, and PsExec—to blend their activities with administrative operations.
      – Renamed Sysinternals tools have been observed, suggesting attempts to subvert traditional file reputation checks and conceal the misuse of trusted utilities.

────────────────────────────
CONCLUSION

The gathered evidence indicates a coordinated attack in which the adversary prepared multiple attack stages—from gaining initial access through fast lateral movement and credential theft to disabling recovery options and attempting to deploy ransomware. The use of trusted system utilities in a malicious manner, coupled with well–known threat actor profiles, underscores the need to rapidly remediate (e.g. by resetting credentials, isolating affected endpoints, restoring backups if available) and perform a full forensic investigation to prevent further compromise. Immediate action by incident response teams and additional network monitoring are essential to contain the threat and prevent recurrence.

Security teams should prioritize remediation efforts on all affected endpoints, review and update security configurations (including patching and anti‐malware rules), and consider enhanced detection of suspicious process spawning and abnormal WMI/PSExec usage.
