Title  
-----  
Macro‐Enabled Document Dropper with PowerShell Backdoor Deployment and Dual Persistence Mechanisms  

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
-----------------  
On June 26, 2024, the user “samuelf” on Windows 10 host vnevado-win10e opened a weaponized Word document (RS4_WinATP-Intro-Invoice.docm). A malicious macro triggered PowerShell execution in memory (T1059.001), which decoded and dropped a backdoor executable (WinATP-Intro-Backdoor.exe) to the user’s Desktop. The attacker established persistence via:  
• A RunOnce registry key entry (T1547.001) pointing to the dropped backdoor.  
• A one‐time Scheduled Task named “Yrei” (T1053.005) set to run the backdoor at a scheduled time.  

Shortly thereafter, the backdoor initiated LDAP reconnaissance against the domain controller (T1018, T1087.x), obtaining directory information. Microsoft Defender ATP generated a sequence of alerts spanning “Execution,” “Persistence,” and “Discovery” tactics. Automated and manual investigations deemed some artifacts benign after remediation, but confirmed the attacker’s multi‐stage activity.  

INCIDENT TIMELINE  
-----------------  
2024-06-26 11:57:19 UTC  
 • winword.exe (PID 9780) launched via user opening RS4_WinATP-Intro-Invoice.docm.  
 • PowerShell invoked by WINWORD.EXE with execution policy bypass to run embedded Base64 decoder script.  

2024-06-26 12:00:39 UTC  
 • Suspicious PowerShell command line detected (Alert #3, T1059.001).  
 • PowerShell dropped WinATP‐Intro‐Backdoor.exe to Desktop and executed it (Alert #25).  

2024-06-26 12:00:40 UTC  
 • schtasks.exe created a one‐off scheduled task “Yrei” to run the backdoor (Alert #20).  
 • schtasks.exe ran the “Yrei” task immediately, launching the backdoor (Alert #21).  

2024-06-26 13:17:18 UTC  
 • reg.exe added a RunOnce registry value under HKCU\…\RunOnce\Yrei to launch the backdoor on next logon (Alert #17 & #23).  

2024-06-26 11:57:25 UTC  
 • Backdoor (or payload script) executed an LDAP query against the domain controller to enumerate users and groups (Alert #24).  

2024-07-04 22:35 UTC  
 • Automated and user‐initiated investigations in MDATP triaged and resolved alerts.  

TECHNICAL ANALYSIS  
-------------------  
1. Delivery & Initial Execution (T1204.002 → T1059.001)  
 • Node 11: WINWORD.EXE opened the malicious .docm.  
 • Nodes 7 & 8: PowerShell launched with “-Exec Bypass -Command” to assemble Base64 chunks and write WinATP-Intro-Backdoor.exe.  
 • Alerts:  
  – #3 “Suspicious process executed PowerShell command”  
  – #10 “Suspicious PowerShell command line”  
  – #26 “Suspicious PowerShell download or encoded command execution”  

2. Payload Drop & Execution (T1059.001)  
 • Node 16: WinATP-Intro-Backdoor.exe created on Desktop.  
 • Alert #25: “PowerShell dropped a suspicious file on the machine.”  

3. Persistence Mechanisms  
 a. Scheduled Task (T1053.005)  
  • Node 13 (PID 1348): schtasks.exe /create /SC ONCE /TN Yrei /TR “…Backdoor.exe”  
  • Alert #20: “An anomalous scheduled task was created.”  
  • Alert #21: “Suspicious Task Scheduler activity” when the task ran.  

 b. Registry RunOnce (T1547.001)  
  • Node 19 (PID 10208): reg.exe ADD HKCU\…\RunOnce /v Yrei /d %userprofile%\Desktop\Backdoor.exe  
  • Alert #17: “Anomaly detected in ASEP registry”  
  • Alert #23: “An uncommon file was created and added to a Run Key”  

4. Discovery & Reconnaissance (T1018, T1069, T1087, T1558.003)  
 • Node 24: LDAP query via backdoor or script to enumerate directory info.  
 • Alert #24: “Suspicious LDAP query.”  

5. Investigation & Triage  
 • Node 0: Automated investigation started and marked benign for some artifacts.  
 • Alerts resolved in MDATP console; manual follow‐up recommended (patch, AV, forensic).

ATTACK METHODOLOGY  
-------------------

SEVERITY ASSESSMENT  
-------------------  
Impact: High – execution of a persistent backdoor, credential and directory enumeration.  
Confidentiality & Integrity: Attacker maintained foothold and could exfiltrate or modify data.  
Availability: No direct impact observed, but persistence allows future disruptive actions.
