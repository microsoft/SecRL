Title: “Phishing‐Driven Domain Credential Harvest and Cloud Evasion Attack”

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
On August 1, 2024, an attacker deployed a multi‐stage campaign against AlpineSkiHouse. A targeted phishing email containing a malicious URL was delivered to user “alyssat@vnevado.alpineskihouse.co” (Hailey Johnson). The user clicked the link, which initiated further payload retrieval and C2 communications from the host vnevado-win11h. The actor then performed suspicious Azure Resource Manager operations via a proxy/TOR‐associated IP, abusing compromised credentials. Soon after, the adversary executed credential‐dumping commands on the domain controller vnevado-dc, extracting NTDS.dit via ntdsutil. The attack blended traditional e-mail phishing, proxy evasion, and on-premises credential theft to achieve domain compromise.

TECHNICAL ANALYSIS  
Stage 1 – Initial Access (T1566.002)  
• A phishing email (“Follow up – Security 101 content”) delivered to alyssat@… contained URL dj01161621.bravesand-e1ccd718.eastus.azurecontainerapps.io.  
• Hailey Johnson clicked it via msedge.exe (PID 4256) on host vnevado-win11h (172.33.118.200), triggering Office 365 ATP and ZAP quarantine.  

Stage 2 – Command & Control / Proxy Evasion  
• vnevado-win11h (231.60.52.209) reached out to login.micro.demo.antoinetest.ovh, a TI-matched malicious domain.  
• The attacker leveraged proxy/TOR IP 253.1.244.215 for Azure Resource Manager activities against subscription 7e838342-… (Resource Group ctfcat) and VM vnevado-dc.  

Stage 3 – Credential Access (T1003, T1003.003)  
• On domain controller vnevado-dc, PowerShell (PID 2556, SHA256=de96a6e6…ab32c) executed an encoded script to prepare an IFM snapshot.  
• ntdsutil.exe (PID 6748, SHA256=0a302650…6e36b5e) ran “ac i ntds ifm create full c:\temp” to dump NTDS.dit.  

Stage 4 – Discovery & Collection (T1018; T1069.002; T1087.002; T1482)  
• Ntdsutil usage flagged under Collection and Discovery categories—adversary gathering AD database and permissions for potential persistence or lateral movement.  

Stage 5 – Cloud Evasion & Persistence (T1496)  
• Risky user Hailey Johnson’s Azure activity raised Entra ID Protection alerts. The actor attempted ARM operations (VM run‐command, listing NICs, schedules) to probe or alter cloud assets.

• Processes: PID 2556 (PowerShell); PID 6748 (ntdsutil.exe)  

SEVERITY ASSESSMENT  
Overall Impact: High  
• Complete compromise of a user account and workstation  
• Unauthorized credential dump of domain controller’s NTDS.dit threatens full AD domain takeover  
• Use of proxy/TOR for cloud operations indicates intent to evade detection and abuse Azure resources  
• Immediate risk of lateral movement, privilege escalation, and persistent foothold both on-prem and in cloud
