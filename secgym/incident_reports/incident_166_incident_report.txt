========================================
Title: Multi-Stage Credential Abuse and Lateral Exploitation via Anonymous Access, Inbox Manipulation, and SAP Compromise
========================================

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
----------------------------------------
On July 22, 2024, a sophisticated multi-vector attack was detected targeting a single compromised account (Jordan P / laylaw@vnevado.alpineskihouse.co). The adversary began with anonymous, high-risk sign-in attempts from anonymized IP addresses, progressed through the creation and manipulation of suspicious inbox rules to facilitate concealment and possible phishing, attempted credential abuse with password spraying, and ultimately exploited access to sensitive enterprise applications such as Microsoft Exchange Online, Office 365, and SAP. In parallel, additional alerts indicated suspicious SAP authentications and business email compromise (BEC) related activities, potentially aimed at financial fraud and data exfiltration.

2. INCIDENT TIMELINE
----------------------------------------
• 2024-07-22 08:41 – 08:45 UTC:  
  • Initial sign-in attempt from an anonymous IP (95.202.65.202) detected (Alert Node 0).  
  • Evidence of a covert logon session using anonymizing tools is observed.

• 2024-07-22 09:07 – 09:11 UTC:  
  • A subsequent sign-in from another anonymous IP (192.238.237.190) is recorded (Alert Node 3), indicating a second attempt to obfuscate identity during access.

• 2024-07-22 08:18 – 09:38 UTC:  
  • Early indicators of mailbox rule manipulation are logged (Alert Node 5) on the target user’s inbox – rule creation (“ITCleanup” moving messages to “RSS Feeds”) suggestive of preparatory actions for concealing activity or exfiltrating communications.

• 2024-07-22 09:37 UTC:  
  • Two concurrent alerts are triggered:  
    – A suspicious inbox manipulation rule (Alert Node 16) with associated remediation procedures.  
    – A BEC financial fraud alert (Alert Node 17) implies that compromised mailbox settings are being used to facilitate fraudulent transactions.

• 2024-07-22 09:38 UTC:  
  • Suspicious emails emanating from the compromised account (Alert Node 18) are sent to an external recipient (tony@avoriaz.alpineskihouse.co), further confirming lateral movement.

• 2024-07-22 09:46 UTC:  
  • Multiple SAP-related alerts appear almost simultaneously:  
    – A suspicious SAP authentication (Alert Node 23) is triggered when the compromised account accesses SAP.  
    – Additional SAP authentication alerts (Nodes 26 and 27) confirm that the same account continues risky access, potentially to search or modify sensitive financial information.

• 2024-07-23 14:23 UTC:  
  • A Password Spray alert (Alert Node 28) is recorded, indicating that the attacker also initiated brute-force attempts against various accounts using common passwords.

• 2024-07-23 16:09 UTC:  
  • A Possible BEC financial fraud alert (Alert Node 29) consolidates earlier BEC suspicious activities, reinforcing the notion of financial fraud or data exfiltration attempts.

3. TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------
• Anonymous Sign-Ins (Nodes 0 & 3):  
  – Alerts reveal sign-in activity using anonymous IP addresses (95.202.65.202 and 192.238.237.190).  
  – These attempts, flagged with medium severity and classified under Initial Access, indicate methods to mask true geographic origins via anonymizers such as Tor or VPNs.

• Suspicious Inbox Manipulation (Nodes 5 & 16):  
  – Multiple alerts describe the creation and modification of inbox rules in the target mailbox.  
  – The creation of a “MoveToFolder” rule (e.g., ITCleanup moving messages to “RSS Feeds”) is anomalous and points to tactics meant to hide phishing, delete legitimate emails, or automate exfiltration.  
  – Entities linked include the compromised account “Jordan P” and associated cloud applications (Microsoft Exchange Online and Office 365).

• Business Email Compromise (BEC) and Fraud Attempts (Nodes 17 & 29):  
  – Alerts flag high-risk actions where the manipulated mailbox is exploited to send fraudulent emails.  
  – The BEC financial fraud incidents involve both direct fraudulent rule creation and suspicious outbound messaging, highlighting a concerted effort to leverage the compromised account for financial gain.

• Suspicious SAP Authentication (Nodes 23, 26 & 27):  
  – Alerts indicate that post-compromise, the adversary accessed SAP systems.  
  – The alerts suggest the attacker might be harvesting or altering sensitive financial information, which could be used to prepare further social engineering or phishing campaigns.

• Password Spray Attack (Node 28):  
  – A high-severity alert indicates a password spraying attempt targeting multiple accounts using the same weak credentials.  
  – The overlapping IP (95.202.65.202) confirms its role in initial access and brute-force credential attacks under the CredentialAccess tactic.

Relationships:  
  – The compromised account “Jordan P” (and various representations via AadUserId, Sid, and email) is central to nearly all events.  
  – Multiple alerts are connected via shared entities (anonymous IPs, cloud applications, and mailboxes), suggesting the adversary pivoted from initial anonymous access to account compromise and lateral movement into critical enterprise resources.  
  – Correlation between SAP authentications, BEC alerts, and password spraying establishes a coherent attack chain that includes initial access, persistence, and potential data exfiltration.

4. AFFECTED ENTITIES

5. ATTACK METHODOLOGY (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures)
----------------------------------------
• Initial Access & Reconnaissance:  
  – Use of anonymizing IP addresses (Tactics: InitialAccess) to hide the origin of intrusion (Technique: Anonymous Login).

• Credential Exploitation:  
  – Password spray attack (Tactics: CredentialAccess; Techniques: T1110.003, T1110.001) intended to breach multiple accounts using common passwords.

• Persistence & Defense Evasion:  
  – Suspicious manipulation of inbox rules (Techniques: T1564, sub-technique T1564.008) to hide evidence of intrusion or to automate phishing and exfiltration.
  – Business Email Compromise tactics to facilitate unauthorized financial transactions.

• Lateral Movement & Abuse of Privileges:  
  – SAP authentication alerts indicate lateral movement into critical enterprise systems (Technique: using valid compromised credentials – T1078).

• Impact:  
  – Fraudulent email communications and potential exfiltration attempts (indicating financial fraud attempts and data exfiltration strategies).

  – SID: S-1-5-21-1740051960-3534030288-108486866-1602

• Application Artifacts:  
  – Suspicious inbox rule “ITCleanup” on the mailbox laylaw@vnevado.alpineskihouse.co  
  – Anomalous SAP sign-in events accompanying defense evasion alerts

• Behavioral:  
  – Unusual sign-in sessions via anonymized IPs  
  – Multiple cloud logon sessions with inconsistent user agent/geo-location information  
  – Temporal clustering of suspicious inbox rule changes, outbound emails, and SAP authentications

7. SEVERITY ASSESSMENT
----------------------------------------
Overall Impact: HIGH  
• The multi-staged attack leverages valid credentials and stealth techniques making detection difficult until multiple systems are compromised.  
• Financial fraud risk is evident with BEC-related alerts.  
• Lateral movement into critical enterprise systems (SAP, Office 365, Exchange Online) escalates potential data loss and financial exposure.  
• The password spray attempt suggests a broad probing scope beyond the initial compromised account, indicating potential wider impact.
