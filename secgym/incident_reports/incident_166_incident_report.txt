Title of the multi-stage attack  
Business Email Compromise & Data Exfiltration via Inbox Rule Manipulation and SAP Access  

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
Over a 36-hour period beginning July 22, 2024, an attacker leveraged anonymous IP logons and a password-spray campaign to gain initial access to the corporate Azure AD account of “Jordan P” (laylaw@vnevado.alpineskihouse.co). Once inside, the actor deployed malicious inbox rules (T1564.008) to hide and move mail for exfiltration, conducted a business-email-compromise (BEC) campaign against an internal recipient (tony@avoriaz.alpineskihouse.co), and then authenticated to SAP (T1078) to harvest sensitive financial data. The incident spans techniques in Initial Access, Credential Access, Defense Evasion, Collection and Exfiltration, and culminates in potential financial fraud.

 • Second Anonymous IP sign-in (192.238.237.190, Hamburg, DE) for same user  

2024-07-22 09:38 UTC (window 09:18–09:49)  
 • MCAS “Suspicious inbox manipulation rule” (High)  
   – New MoveToFolder rule “ITCleanup” on laylaw@…  
   – IPs involved: 180.144.153.174, 95.202.65.202, 192.238.237.190, and attacker IP 255.246.85.58

   – laylaw@… signs in to SAP app “Lia” (AppId=100) from IP 107.253.5.27  
 • Repeat SAP alerts processed at 12:59, 13:19, 14:09 UTC  

2024-07-23 14:23 UTC (retroactive processing)

 • MTP “Possible BEC financial fraud” (Medium, T1114.003)  
   – laylaw@… flagged as Compromised  

3. TECHNICAL ANALYSIS  
• Initial Access: Anonymous IP alerts (Nodes 0 & 3) and Password Spray (Node 28) indicate brute-force attempts from Tor-exit and anonymizing VPNs (95.202.65.202, 192.238.237.190).  
• Defense Evasion & Persistence: MCAS and Defender365 detect creation of a stealth inbox rule “ITCleanup” (Nodes 5 & 16) to auto-move or hide legitimate emails in Jordan P’s mailbox, with attacker IP 255.246.85.58 marked “Attacker.”  
• Collection & Exfiltration: Suspicious outbound email (Node 18) to tony@avoriaz.alpineskihouse.co carries potential fraudulent instructions or invoice requests (T1586). A mail-message entity (Node 20–22) tied to IP 255.246.85.58 confirms exfiltration channel  
• Lateral Movement & Data Harvesting: Multiple “Suspicious SAP authentication” alerts (Nodes 23, 26, 27) show same compromised account signing into enterprise SAP application “Lia” using stolen credentials, searching financial records (T1078).  

Edge relationships confirm that all major alerts pivot on the single compromised account (AadUserId=89e933b9…ef82), with IPs and cloud-application entities linking each stage.

7. SEVERITY ASSESSMENT  
Overall impact is High. The attacker achieved account takeover of a privileged user mailbox, established persistent mailbox rule-based exfiltration, orchestrated BEC fraud, and accessed sensitive financial systems. The combination of credential compromise, data manipulation, and potential fund diversion poses significant financial and reputational risk.
