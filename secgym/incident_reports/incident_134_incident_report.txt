Title: Multi-Stage Phishing-Driven BEC and Account Takeover Attack

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
On July 17–18, 2024, the user “raphaelt@vnevado.alpineskihouse.co” (Nina Park) fell victim to a phishing campaign that delivered a malicious URL. Following the click, an attacker leveraged that access to perform unauthorized sign-ins from anonymizing and malicious IP addresses, manipulated the user’s Outlook inbox rules to hide incoming mail, and executed a business email compromise (BEC) fraud attempt by sending spoofed emails to external recipients. Over the next 24 hours, the attacker escalated with a password-spray attack against Azure AD, resulting in a confirmed account takeover. This multi-stage chain encompassed Initial Access (T1566), Credential Access (T1110), Defense Evasion (T1564), Collection (T1114), and Reconnaissance/Suspicious Activity (T1586).

3. TECHNICAL ANALYSIS  
Alert 13 & 0 (T1566.002)  
– A phishing email from alyssat@… (IP 254.241.243.229) targeted raphaelt@… with a malicious link. Office 365 ATP quarantined subsequent deliveries, but the user clicked before removal, establishing initial foothold.  

Alert 11, 23 & 24 (Initial Access & Credential Access)  
– Shortly after the click, a cloud-logon from IP 170.54.121.63 (Amsterdam; anonymizer/Tor) succeeded, indicating the attacker either harvested credentials or session tokens. Azure AD Identity Protection flagged the IP as both anonymous and malicious and detected a password spray against multiple accounts.  

Alerts 14 & 17 (Defense Evasion & Collection)  
– Within 15 minutes of initial access, the attacker modified Nina Park’s Outlook inbox rules to hide or delete incoming messages, preventing detection and facilitating covert BEC operations.  

Alert 18 (Suspicious Activity)  
– Using the compromised mailbox, the attacker dispatched fraudulent invoices or event invitations to “Nathan@avoriaz…”, likely aiming to extort or redirect payments (BEC/T1586).  

Alerts 25 (Account Compromise Confirmation)  
– A day later, a full account takeover is confirmed post-password-spray; sign-in patterns and browser attributes were anomalous.  

Edge relationships track the progression from the original phishing alert (0) through email quarantine events (13), to account alerts (11, 23, 24), inbox manipulation (14, 17), outbound BEC (18), and final takeover (25).
