1. Event: OneNote.exe executes some OneNote file.
    Result: This execution exported an HTA (HTML Application) file named Urukhai.hta which is then launched by mshta (Microsoft HTML Application Host).

2. Event: mshta (Microsoft HTML Application Host) launches mshta (Microsoft HTML Application Host).
    Result:
    - A remote connection is intiated, the remote IP address is 192.168.3.5, which is used to set up the C2 connection.
    - PowerShell is spawned by mshta, potentially downloading an additional script and executing it in memory.

3. Event: `mshta` executes a process that makes a network connection.
   Result: Establishes a connection to remote IP address `192.168.3.5` for C2 communication, and `PowerShell` script is potentially downloading and executing an additional script in memory.

4. Event: Some powershell scripts are executed.
   Result: Downloads a `Sliver` payload binary which gets executed and detected as malicious.

5. Event: `OneNote` file downloaded from a URL.
   Result: The file `FestivalDeVina.one` is downloaded to `C:\Users\lrodriguez\Downloads` folder via `msedge.exe` (browser) from the URL `defenderatevet06-my.sharepoint.com/personal/sbeavers_peanutrecords_com/_layouts/15/download.aspx`.

6. Event: Phishing email containing download link for OneNote file.
   Result: The phishing email is sent from `sbeavers@peanutrecords.com` to `lrodriguez@peanutrecords.com` with subject `Nuevos Contactos de Festival De vina 2023!`. The email contains a link to download the OneNote file from Stevie Beavers' SharePoint.

7. Event: `sbeavers@peanutrecords.com` uploads/creates OneNote file on SharePoint.
   Result: The malicious OneNote file `FestivalDeVina.one` is created/uploaded in Stevie's OneDrive using Microsoft Graph API and PowerShell Cmdlets.

8. Event: Device Code Authentication Flow phishing email sent to Stevie Beavers.
   Result: The email from `azure-noreply@microsoft.com` (spoofed) contains the URL `https://microsoft.com/devicelogin`, which Stevie clicks, leading to a device code phishing attack.

9. Event: Stevie Beavers authenticates using Device Code Authentication Flow.
   Result: Threat actor gains access token for Microsoft Graph API, allowing them to upload the malicious OneNote file to Stevie's OneDrive.

10. Event: `Sliver` binary executed.
    Result: `Sliver` executable (`DoorBreach.exe`) performs suspicious LDAP queries and executes commands on endpoints.

11. Event: PowerShell script executed to download and extract a file.
    Result: A compressed file is downloaded to the Windows Temp folder, and its contents are extracted to the ProgramData directory, containing a GPO named `ManeuverWarfare`.

12. Event: GPO named `ManeuverWarfare` imported.
    Result: The GPO is applied to the Domain, attaching to the `Workstations` AD organizational unit, potentially spreading settings to all endpoints in the domain.

13. Event: GPO named `BlitzSvc` imported.
    Result: Another GPO named `BlitzSvc` is imported and applied to all workstations, alongside `ManeuverWarfare`.

14. Event: Scheduled Task `BlitzConfig` created on all workstations.
    Result: `BlitzConfig` scheduled task executes a PowerShell script which disables system recovery, deletes backups, encrypts files, and displays a ransom note (`Invoke-Berserker` function).

15. Event: Group Policy forced update on workstations.
    Result: Threat actor uses LDAP queries to enumerate endpoints and WMI to force a Group Policy update (`gpupdate`) on all of those endpoints.
