If this query was launched by an account that is a member of one of these groups, it is likely that the key material was successfully accessed.\n\n3.

It was notorious for one of its earliest malware lexpaigns – the Dridex banking trojan. Manatee Tempest is also one of the first groups to be sanctioned by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in 2019.

Manatee Tempest’s tactics rely on a partnership with Mustard Tempest, an access broker that facilitates access to target networks. Manatee Tempest has been observed targeting organizations across a diverse array of industries with methods such as drive-by download, including malvertising and FakeUpdates (also known as SocGholish) infections facilitated by Mustard Tempest to obtain initial access, followed by BLISTER loader to deliver Cobalt Strike beacons which are used for lateral movement and ransomware deployment. The actor also uses domain fronting to establish command-and-control channel for Cobalt Strike beacons. Manatee Tempest overlaps with activity tracked by the cyber intelligence industry as EvilCorp, UNC2165, and Indrik Spider.

It was notorious for one of its earliest malware lexpaigns – the Dridex banking trojan. Manatee Tempest is also one of the first groups to be sanctioned by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in 2019.

Manatee Tempest’s tactics rely on a partnership with Mustard Tempest, an access broker that facilitates access to target networks. Manatee Tempest has been observed targeting organizations across a diverse array of industries with methods such as drive-by download, including malvertising and FakeUpdates (also known as SocGholish) infections facilitated by Mustard Tempest to obtain initial access, followed by BLISTER loader to deliver Cobalt Strike beacons which are used for lateral movement and ransomware deployment. The actor also uses domain fronting to establish command-and-control channel for Cobalt Strike beacons. Manatee Tempest overlaps with activity tracked by the cyber intelligence industry as EvilCorp, UNC2165, and Indrik Spider.

Adversaries might be attempting to delete or remove built-in operating system data and turn off recovery services to prevent recovering a corrupted system. This may deny access to available backups and recovery options.

Operating systems may contain features that can help fix corrupted systems, such as a backup catalog, volume shadow copies, and automatic repair features. Adversaries may stop or delete system recovery features to augment the effects of Data Destruction and Data Encrypted for Impact.

Many native Windows utilities have been used by adversaries to disable or delete system recovery features:
•	 vssblatemp.exe can be used to delete all volume shadow copies on a system using the following command: [vssblatemp.exe delete shadows /all /quiet]
•	Windows Management Instrumentation can be used to delete volume shadow copies using the following command: [wmic shadowcopy delete]
•	wbblatemp.exe can be used to delete the Windows Backup Catalog using the following command: [wbblatemp.exe delete catalog -quiet]
•	bcdedit.exe can be used to disable automatic Windows recovery features by modifying boot configuration data using the following command: [bcdedit.exe /set default bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures & bcdedit /set default recoveryenabled no]"❖MDATP❖Microsoft❖3fcede41-9fdb-4dfb-9fd0-69f1c6fa88bf_1❖8edf196f-fae8-6f94-3acd-93c648e9aa1f❖❖❖WindowsDefenderAtp❖❖❖False❖2024-06-20 09:29:38.767268+00:00❖2024-06-20 09:29:41.284899+00:00❖2024-07-04 22:34:59.886669+00:00❖"[""1.

Adversaries might be attempting to delete or remove built-in operating system data and turn off recovery services to prevent recovering a corrupted system. This may deny access to available backups and recovery options.

Operating systems may contain features that can help fix corrupted systems, such as a backup catalog, volume shadow copies, and automatic repair features. Adversaries may stop or delete system recovery features to augment the effects of Data Destruction and Data Encrypted for Impact.

Many native Windows utilities have been used by adversaries to disable or delete system recovery features:
•	 vssblatemp.exe can be used to delete all volume shadow copies on a system using the following command: [vssblatemp.exe delete shadows /all /quiet]
•	Windows Management Instrumentation can be used to delete volume shadow copies using the following command: [wmic shadowcopy delete]
•	wbblatemp.exe can be used to delete the Windows Backup Catalog using the following command: [wbblatemp.exe delete catalog -quiet]

It was notorious for one of its earliest malware lexpaigns – the Dridex banking trojan. Manatee Tempest is also one of the first groups to be sanctioned by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in 2019.

Manatee Tempest’s tactics rely on a partnership with Mustard Tempest, an access broker that facilitates access to target networks. Manatee Tempest has been observed targeting organizations across a diverse array of industries with methods such as drive-by download, including malvertising and FakeUpdates (also known as SocGholish) infections facilitated by Mustard Tempest to obtain initial access, followed by BLISTER loader to deliver Cobalt Strike beacons which are used for lateral movement and ransomware deployment. The actor also uses domain fronting to establish command-and-control channel for Cobalt Strike beacons. Manatee Tempest overlaps with activity tracked by the cyber intelligence industry as EvilCorp, UNC2165, and Indrik Spider.

It was notorious for one of its earliest malware lexpaigns – the Dridex banking trojan. Manatee Tempest is also one of the first groups to be sanctioned by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in 2019.

Manatee Tempest’s tactics rely on a partnership with Mustard Tempest, an access broker that facilitates access to target networks. Manatee Tempest has been observed targeting organizations across a diverse array of industries with methods such as drive-by download, including malvertising and FakeUpdates (also known as SocGholish) infections facilitated by Mustard Tempest to obtain initial access, followed by BLISTER loader to deliver Cobalt Strike beacons which are used for lateral movement and ransomware deployment. The actor also uses domain fronting to establish command-and-control channel for Cobalt Strike beacons. Manatee Tempest overlaps with activity tracked by the cyber intelligence industry as EvilCorp, UNC2165, and Indrik Spider.

Use the incident page as guide for the rest of the investigation.\n\nInvestigate threat scope and impact\n1. Check whether any of the files were executed, and if so, assess the impact.\n2. Identify the source of the dropped file. Determine whether the communication source is internal or external to the organization, and whether the activity is expected (for example, penetration testing).\n3. Investigate the source and target devices for additional related alerts and activities. Find out whether they are part of a wider incident. The incident might already have correlated activities and impacted assets. Use the incident page as guide for the rest of your investigation. Use the alert page and device timelines to investigate related activities.\n4. Identify unexpected processes, check suspicious files for prevalence, location and digital signature, submit for deep analysis to inspect behaviors. Identify communications to suspect network addresses & domains. Verify unusual activities with server owners.\n5.  Pivot on any evidence entities to determine the full scope of the threat and find any additional impacted devices and other assets. Use the entity page Observed in org tab or Advanced Hunting to search for other occurrences of these indicators across the organization.\n\nContain the threat\n1. If the activity on this device is unexpected and the device displays indications of compromise, isolate the device to prevent the threat from progressing. Assess tbayuctivity implications and potential attack risk before doing so.\n2. If an internal source device was identified, isolate the source device. Assess the tbayuctivity implications and potential attack risk before doing so. If the source device identified is external, block communications to its network (IP) address.\n\nRemediate the threat\n1. Clean up or reinstall affected devices to remove malicious components and return them to a clean state. Reset passwords of affected accounts. Add all identified threat indicators to block lists using the Indicators page.\n2.

A malware is considered active if it is found running on the machine or it already has persistence mechanisms in place. Active malware detections are assigned higher severity ratings.
