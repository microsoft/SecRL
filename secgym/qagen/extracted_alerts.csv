It was notorious for one of its earliest malware campaigns – the Dridex banking trojan. Manatee Tempest is also one of the first groups to be sanctioned by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in 2019.

Manatee Tempest’s tactics rely on a partnership with Mustard Tempest, an access broker that facilitates access to target networks. Manatee Tempest has been observed targeting organizations across a diverse array of industries with methods such as drive-by download, including malvertising and FakeUpdates (also known as SocGholish) infections facilitated by Mustard Tempest to obtain initial access, followed by BLISTER loader to deliver Cobalt Strike beacons which are used for lateral movement and ransomware deployment. The actor also uses domain fronting to establish command-and-control channel for Cobalt Strike beacons. Manatee Tempest overlaps with activity tracked by the cyber intelligence industry as EvilCorp, UNC2165, and Indrik Spider.

Manatee Tempest is also one of the first groups to be sanctioned by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in 2019.

Manatee Tempest’s tactics rely on a partnership with Mustard Tempest, an access broker that facilitates access to target networks. Manatee Tempest has been observed targeting organizations across a diverse array of industries with methods such as drive-by download, including malvertising and FakeUpdates (also known as SocGholish) infections facilitated by Mustard Tempest to obtain initial access, followed by BLISTER loader to deliver Cobalt Strike beacons which are used for lateral movement and ransomware deployment. The actor also uses domain fronting to establish command-and-control channel for Cobalt Strike beacons. Manatee Tempest overlaps with activity tracked by the cyber intelligence industry as EvilCorp, UNC2165, and Indrik Spider.

It was notorious for one of its earliest malware campaigns – the Dridex banking trojan. Manatee Tempest is also one of the first groups to be sanctioned by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in 2019.

Manatee Tempest’s tactics rely on a partnership with Mustard Tempest, an access broker that facilitates access to target networks. Manatee Tempest has been observed targeting organizations across a diverse array of industries with methods such as drive-by download, including malvertising and FakeUpdates (also known as SocGholish) infections facilitated by Mustard Tempest to obtain initial access, followed by BLISTER loader to deliver Cobalt Strike beacons which are used for lateral movement and ransomware deployment. The actor also uses domain fronting to establish command-and-control channel for Cobalt Strike beacons. Manatee Tempest overlaps with activity tracked by the cyber intelligence industry as EvilCorp, UNC2165, and Indrik Spider.

It was notorious for one of its earliest malware campaigns – the Dridex banking trojan. Manatee Tempest is also one of the first groups to be sanctioned by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in 2019.

Manatee Tempest’s tactics rely on a partnership with Mustard Tempest, an access broker that facilitates access to target networks. Manatee Tempest has been observed targeting organizations across a diverse array of industries with methods such as drive-by download, including malvertising and FakeUpdates (also known as SocGholish) infections facilitated by Mustard Tempest to obtain initial access, followed by BLISTER loader to deliver Cobalt Strike beacons which are used for lateral movement and ransomware deployment. The actor also uses domain fronting to establish command-and-control channel for Cobalt Strike beacons. Manatee Tempest overlaps with activity tracked by the cyber intelligence industry as EvilCorp, UNC2165, and Indrik Spider.

•	Windows Management Instrumentation can be used to delete volume shadow copies using the following command: [wmic shadowcopy delete]
•	wbadmin.exe can be used to delete the Windows Backup Catalog using the following command: [wbadmin.exe delete catalog -quiet]
•	bcdedit.exe can be used to disable automatic Windows recovery features by modifying boot configuration data using the following command: [bcdedit.exe /set default bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures & bcdedit /set default recoveryenabled no]",MDATP,Microsoft,3fcede41-9fdb-4dfb-9fd0-69f1c6fa88bf_1,8edf196f-fae8-6f94-3acd-93c648e9aa1f,,,WindowsDefenderAtp,,,False,2024-06-20 09:29:38.767268+00:00,2024-06-20 09:29:41.284899+00:00,2024-06-20 09:39:59.777330+00:00,"[""1.

Identify commonalities and differences between potentially compromised systems. \n4. Submit relevant files for deep analysis and review resulting detailed behavioral information. \n5. If alert characteristics and machine behavioral evidence constitute a true positive, consider some of the initial mitigation actions below. Then, contact your incident response team for potential forensic analysis and remediation. \n\nInitiate containment & mitigation  \n1. Record all relevant artifacts to be used in mitigation rules and as new threat intel \n2. Contact the user to check if the observed behavior was intended. \n3. Update AV signatures and run a full scan. The scan might reveal and remove previously-undetected malware components. \n4. Ensure that the machine has the latest security updates. In particular, ensure that you have installed the latest software, web browser, and Operating System versions. \n5. If credential theft is suspected, reset all relevant users passwords. \n6.

Inspect the process initiated the registry write for suspicious characteristics – is it digitally signed? How prevalent is it? Where is it located? Do the domain registration and hosting history look normal? \n2. Review the machine timeline for suspicious activities that may have occurred before and after the time of the alert. \n3. Look for the presence of relevant artifacts on other systems. Identify commonalities and differences between potentially compromised systems. \n4. Submit relevant files for deep analysis and review resulting detailed behavioral information. \n5. If alert characteristics and machine behavioral evidence constitute a true positive, consider some of the initial mitigation actions below. Then, contact your incident response team for potential forensic analysis and remediation. \n\nInitiate containment & mitigation \n1. Record all relevant artifacts to be used in mitigation rules and as new threat intel \n2. Contact the user to check if the observed behavior was intended. \n3. Update AV signatures and run a full scan. The scan might reveal and remove previously-undetected malware components. \n4. Ensure that the machine has the latest security updates. In particular, ensure that you have installed the latest software, web browser, and Operating System versions. \n5. If credential theft is suspected, reset all relevant users passwords.\n6.

Identify the source of the dropped file. Determine whether the communication source is internal or external to the organization, and whether the activity is expected (for example, penetration testing).\n3.

The incident might already have correlated activities and impacted assets. Use the incident page as guide for the rest of your investigation. Use the alert page and device timelines to investigate related activities.\n4. Identify unexpected processes, check suspicious files for prevalence, location and digital signature, submit for deep analysis to inspect behaviors. Identify communications to suspect network addresses & domains. Verify unusual activities with server owners.\n5.

Assess the productivity implications and potential attack risk before doing so. If the source device identified is external, block communications to its network (IP) address.\n\nRemediate the threat\n1. Clean up or reinstall affected devices to remove malicious components and return them to a clean state. Reset passwords of affected accounts. Add all identified threat indicators to block lists using the Indicators page.\n2.

ADFS key material can be accessed for legitimate purposes.

If the activity is identified as suspicious, check if the key material was retrieved successfully.\nThe ACL applied to the key object in Active Directory typically means that it can only be successfully queried by a member of Domain Administrators, Enterprise Administrators, Key Administrators, the ADFS service account, or a member of the local administrators group of the ADFS server. If this query was launched by an account that is a member of one of these groups, it is likely that the key material was successfully accessed.\n\n3.
