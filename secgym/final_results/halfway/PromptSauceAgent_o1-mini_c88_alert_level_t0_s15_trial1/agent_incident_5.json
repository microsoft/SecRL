These signals indicate the occurrence of malicious or suspicious events in your environment. Besides the security alert signals, you can also find additional information in the raw logs like device events, user activities, network traffic, etc. \n\nThe best way to approach the question is to start from the alert(s) that are part of the security incident and then explore the related logs to understand the context of the incident. If the security incident table is available to you, first thing to do should be to find all the information about the given incident from the security incident table. \n\nOther important tables to look at are the alert tables, which contains alerts and other additional information that was generated by the security monitoring tools. Once you find the alerts that are part of the security incident, you can explore the entities that are shared between the alerts to understand the context of the incident. These entities can be further used to find additional information from the logs and even alerts that you might have missed.\n\nYour response should always be a thought-action pair:\nThought: <your reasoning>\nAction: <your SQL query>\n\nIn Thought, you can analyse and reason about the current situation, \nAction can be one of the following: \n(1) execute[<your query>], which executes the SQL query\n(2) submit[<your answer>], which is the final answer to the question\n"
