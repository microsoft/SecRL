They've tried several tables without success. Here's the thought process:\n\n1. **Previous Tables Checked**: The user has attempted queries on http_events, firewall_logs, security_incidents, threat_intel_matches, network_traffic, dns_queries, and now ids_ips_alerts and web_proxy_logs might be next. All previous tables don't exist in the database.\n\n2. **Possible Tables Left**:\n   - **web_proxy_logs**: This is a common table where proxy servers log URLs accessed, including blocked ones.\n   - **antivirus_logs**: If the URL was detected by antivirus software, it might be logged here.\n   - **email_security_logs**: If the attack vector was phishing, URLs might be in email logs, but less likely for C2.\n   - **system_events**: Unlikely to have URLs, but might have process creation logs related to malware.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Since the URL was blocked, focus on tables that log web traffic and blocks. web_proxy_logs is a strong candidate.\n   - Use the date filter and look for actions like 'blocked' or 'denied'.\n\n4. **Assumptions**:\n   - The environment uses a web proxy, hence web_proxy_logs might exist.\n   - The URL was blocked by the proxy, so the action field would indicate that.\n\n**Next Action**: Query the web_proxy_logs table for blocked URLs on 2024-07-04.\n\n**SQL Query**:\nsql\nSELECT requested_url, timestamp \nFROM web_proxy_logs \nWHERE action = 'blocked' \nAND DATE(timestamp) = '2024-07-04' \nAND threat_category LIKE '%C2%';\n\n\nIf this table doesn't exist, the next step would be to check antivirus_logs for any URL-related detections. However, given the context of C2, the proxy logs are more likely to have the relevant data. If all else fails, exploring system_events for process creations that might reference URLs could be an alternative, though less direct.",
