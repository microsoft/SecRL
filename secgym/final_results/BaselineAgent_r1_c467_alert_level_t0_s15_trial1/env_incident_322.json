The malicious URL click likely used this same IP.\n2. **Database Exploration**: Attempts to query tables like http_requests or security_alerts failed, suggesting logs are structured differently.\n3. **Defender Alert Focus**: The Defender alert specifically flagged a \"suspicious proxy IP\" during the resource management operation.
