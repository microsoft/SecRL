A malicious URL `https://ym018491661.wittytree-b6f239d6.northeurope.azurecontainerapps.io/` was clicked on the device with the hostname `mb-winclient` on 2024-07-10 at 11:24:45.667104+00:00. This event was flagged as part of a security investigation. What is the Azure AD Device ID of the host where the malicious URL was clicked?

Thought: I will start by exploring the schema to identify relevant tables. 
Action: execute[SHOW TABLES;]
Observation:
[('AADManagedIdentitySignInLogs',), ...]


Thought: The `UrlClickEvents` table likely contains information about URL clicks, including the device information. I will query this table to retrieve the Azure AD Device ID. 
Action: execute[SELECT * FROM UrlClickEvents LIMIT 5;]
Observation: 
[('e34d562e-ef12-4c4e-9bc0-7c6ae357c015', '2024-07-05 13:07:27+00:00', ...), ...]

Thought: The `DeviceInfo` table likely contains device details, including the hostname and Azure AD Device ID. I will join the `UrlClickEvents` table with the `DeviceInfo` table using a common identifier, such as the device ID. 
Action: execute[DESCRIBE DeviceInfo;]
Observation:
[('TenantId', 'text', 'YES', '', None, ''), ...]


Thought: The `UrlClickEvents` table includes an `IPAddress` column, which might be used to join with the `DeviceInfo` table's `PublicIP` column. I will join the `UrlClickEvents` table with the `DeviceInfo` table.
Action: execute[SELECT u.*, d.AadDeviceId FROM UrlClickEvents u JOIN DeviceInfo d ON u.IPAddress = d.PublicIP WHERE u.url = 'https://ym018491661.wittytree-b6f239d6.northeurope.azurecontainerapps.io/' AND u.timestamp = '2024-07-10 11:24:45.667104+00:00' AND d.DeviceName = 'mb-winclient';]
Observation:
[]

Thought: Since the previous query did not return any results, it is possible that the event might be logged under a slightly different URL format or the timestamp might be off. I will broaden the search further by looking for any entries with the given URL pattern within a wider time range. 
Action: execute[SELECT * FROM UrlClickEvents WHERE url LIKE '%ym018491661.wittytree-b6f239d6.northeurope.azurecontainerapps.io%';]
Observation:
[(..., '249.123.122.153', ..., '[\"https://ym018491661.wittytree-b6f239d6.northeurope.azurecontainerapps.io/\"]', ..., 'UrlClickEvents')]


Thought: The query returned an entry for the malicious URL clicked on `2024-07-02`. This is not the exact event we are looking for, but it indicates that the URL might be logged with a different timestamp or format. I will now search for any entries in the `DeviceInfo` table that match the IP address `249.123.122.153` to find the corresponding device information. 
Action: execute[SELECT * FROM DeviceInfo WHERE PublicIP = '249.123.122.153';]
Observation:
[('e34d562e-ef12-4c4e-9bc0-7c6ae357c015', ..., 'mb-winclient.internal.niseko.alpineskihouse.co', ..., 'DeviceInfo'), ...]


Thought: The `DeviceInfo` table contains multiple entries for the device with the hostname `mb-winclient.internal.niseko.alpineskihouse.co` and the IP address `249.123.122.153`. The `AadDeviceId` column is empty in these entries. It seems that the `AadDeviceId` might not be directly available in the `DeviceInfo` table for this device. I will now check if there is any other table that might link the `DeviceId` or `DeviceName` to the `AadDeviceId`. 
Action: execute[SELECT * FROM DeviceEvents WHERE DeviceName = 'mb-winclient.internal.niseko.alpineskihouse.co' LIMIT 5;]
Observation:
[('e34d562e-ef12-4c4e-9bc0-7c6ae357c015', ..., '', '31a048e5eea6ad6e6bc025bfa9e0e571c4c20f7e', 'mb-winclient.internal.niseko.alpineskihouse.co', ...), (..., '31a048e5eea6ad6e6bc025bfa9e0e571c4c20f7e', 'mb-winclient.internal.niseko.alpineskihouse.co', ...), ...]


Thought: The `DeviceEvents` table contains entries for the device with the hostname `mb-winclient.internal.niseko.alpineskihouse.co` and includes a `DeviceId` column (`31a048e5eea6ad6e6bc025bfa9e0e571c4c20f7e`). This `DeviceId` can be used to find the corresponding `AadDeviceId` in the `DeviceInfo` table. 
Action: execute[SELECT AadDeviceId FROM DeviceInfo WHERE DeviceId = '31a048e5eea6ad6e6bc025bfa9e0e571c4c20f7e';]
Observation:
[('',), ('',), ('',), ('7661dfd4-218f-4016-8a87-66d68a7f098e',), ...]


Thought: The `AadDeviceId` for the device with the hostname `mb-winclient.internal.niseko.alpineskihouse.co` is `7661dfd4-218f-4016-8a87-66d68a7f098e`. This matches the device where the malicious URL was clicked. 
Action: submit[The Azure AD Device ID of the host where the malicious URL was clicked is `7661dfd4-218f-4016-8a87-66d68a7f098e`.]
