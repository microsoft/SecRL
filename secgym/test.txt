question 120-120 | reward: 0 -> 0.4
Submitted Answer Unable to determine the command and process ID of the other process involved due to lack of entries for device vnevado-win10r in the logs.
Correct Answer Command: bcdedit /set recoveryenabled no, Process ID: 4312
Evaluation Analysis: The submitted answer does not provide the required command and process ID and instead states an inability to determine the information, which means it does not match the golden answer.
Is_Answer_Correct: False
Reflection on Explanation Reflection: The previous evaluation accurately noted that the submitted answer does not provide the required command and process ID and instead states an inability to determine the information. This is a clear discrepancy with the golden answer.

Analysis: The question specifically asks for the command and process ID of the other process involved. The golden answer provides the command `bcdedit /set recoveryenabled no` and the process ID `4312`. The submitted answer indicates an inability to determine this information, which does not fulfill the requirement of providing the specific command and process ID as requested.

question 70-118 | reward: 1 -> 0
Submitted Answer The AAD device IDs associated with successful logon events are: 43a4c3f27b4ff68bfa79a2c4b8873b28d5cd24f0, f76578a00c71e0799ca5ce9b577c831c672fc255, f79d8e59516ec0b531ae1037d0acfa300d028df0.
Correct Answer bc00e484-d0e5-4da4-9472-95568cccc07e
Evaluation Analysis: The submitted answer provides multiple AAD device IDs and none match the golden answer.
Is_Answer_Correct: False
Reflection on Explanation Reflection: The previous evaluation correctly identified that the submitted answer did not match the golden answer. However, it would be beneficial to provide a more in-depth reasoning for the conclusion.

Analysis: The submitted answer lists multiple AAD device IDs associated with successful logon events, none of which match the golden answer (bc00e484-d0e5-4da4-9472-95568cccc07e). Additionally, the context around the submitted answer does not directly address the detection of the Primary Refresh Token (PRT) access attempt as specified in the question. Therefore, the submitted answer does not provide the correct AAD device ID related to the specific incident mentioned.

Is_Answer_Correct: False

Submitted Answer e5799261-6720-4297-961e-bd9ca4275033
Correct Answer bc00e484-d0e5-4da4-9472-95568cccc07e
Evaluation Analysis: The submitted answer does not match the golden answer for the unique identifier 'AadDeviceId'.
Is_Answer_Correct: False
Reflection on Explanation Reflection: The initial evaluation correctly identified that the unique identifier 'AadDeviceId' provided in the submitted answer does not match the golden answer.

Analysis: Upon re-evaluation, the submitted answer "e5799261-6720-4297-961e-bd9ca4275033" does not match the required unique identifier "bc00e484-d0e5-4da4-9472-95568cccc07e". Unique identifiers are exact and should match the golden answer precisely.

question 105-159 | reward: 1 -> 0
Submitted Answer The files involved in the ransomware activity on the host `vnevado-win11t` include: 
1. `chylocaulous.zip.lockbit`
2. `feldspars.xls.lockbit.lockbit`
3. `azinphosmethyl.xlsx.lockbit`
Correct Answer get-userprttoken.ps1
Evaluation Analysis: The submitted answer provides multiple files associated with ransomware activity but does not include the specific file "get-userprttoken.ps1," which is the key information required.
Is_Answer_Correct: False
Reflection on Explanation Reflection: The previous evaluation correctly identified that the submitted answer does not include the specific file "get-userprttoken.ps1," which is the key information required.

Analysis: The submitted answer lists multiple files associated with ransomware activity but fails to mention the specific file "get-userprttoken.ps1." The presence of the exact file mentioned in the golden answer is crucial, and its absence means that the submitted answer does not meet the requirement of containing the key content.

Is_Answer_Correct: False

question 135-98 | reward: 1 -> 0
Submitted Answer vnevado-win10s, vnevado-win10r, vnevado-win11t, vnevado-win11u
Correct Answer vnevado-win10s
Evaluation Analysis: The submitted answer contains the correct host name (vnevado-win10s) along with additional context by listing other host names. This additional context is relevant and helpful for the investigation.
Is_Answer_Correct: True
Reflection on Explanation Reflection: Upon review, the previous evaluation overlooked the potential issue of an overly large enumeration of hostnames. Although the answer contains the correct host name, it must be considered whether listing other hostnames is indeed relevant and helpful or if it merely complicates the response.

Analysis: The submitted answer includes the correct hostname 'vnevado-win10s'. However, it also lists three additional hostnames ('vnevado-win10r', 'vnevado-win11t', 'vnevado-win11u'), which are not directly relevant to the question. The question specifically asks for the hostname where 'CommandAndControl' malware was detected, rather than a broader context of other hostnames, which could lead to potential confusion or unnecessary complexity in the response.

Is_Answer_Correct: False

question 82-147 | reward: 1 -> 0
Submitted Answer The impacted files by ransomware include: bissellia.doc.lockbit, auxohormone.xlsm.lockbit.lockbit, boggin.txt.lockbit, booting.lob.lockbit.lockbit, bosselation.txt.lockbit, buzzgloak.xlsx.lockbit, brackish.zip.lockbit.lockbit, and many others with the .lockbit extension.
Correct Answer unstreaming.xlsx.lockbit
Evaluation Analysis: The submitted answer enumerates multiple files impacted by ransomware but does not specifically include the file `unstreaming.xlsx.lockbit`. It is also an overly large enumeration.
Is_Answer_Correct: False
Reflection on Explanation Reflection: The previous evaluation correctly identified that the submitted answer did not include the specific file `unstreaming.xlsx.lockbit` and noted the overly large enumeration of file names, which impacted the relevance of the response.

Analysis: The golden answer specified that the file impacted by ransomware was `unstreaming.xlsx.lockbit`. However, the submitted answer listed multiple files impacted by ransomware without including the specified file. Additionally, the long enumeration of files diluted the specificity of the answer and failed to address the exact question asked.

Is_Answer_Correct: False
