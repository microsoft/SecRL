Submitted Answer vnevado-win11u.vnevado.alpineskihouse.co
Correct Answer vnevado-win10s
Evaluation Analysis: The submitted answer does not match the golden answer exactly, and it refers to a different device hostname that is already mentioned in the question as related to other suspicious activities, not the system recovery setting tampering.
Is_Answer_Correct: False
Reflection on Explanation Reflection: The previous evaluation was correct in pointing out that the submitted answer does not match the golden answer and refers to a different device. 

Analysis: The submitted answer, `vnevado-win11u.vnevado.alpineskihouse.co`, does not match the golden answer `vnevado-win10s`. It also refers to a device already mentioned in the question (vnevado-win11u) but for different suspicious activity (ransomware behavior, not system recovery setting tampering).

Submitted Answer The AAD device IDs associated with successful logon events are: 43a4c3f27b4ff68bfa79a2c4b8873b28d5cd24f0, f76578a00c71e0799ca5ce9b577c831c672fc255, f79d8e59516ec0b531ae1037d0acfa300d028df0.
Correct Answer bc00e484-d0e5-4da4-9472-95568cccc07e
Evaluation Analysis: The submitted answer does not contain the AAD device ID 'bc00e484-d0e5-4da4-9472-95568cccc07e' as given in the golden answer, and lists other AAD device IDs instead.
Is_Answer_Correct: False
Reflection on Explanation Reflection: The previous evaluation accurately identified that the submitted answer does not contain the specific Azure Active Directory (AAD) device ID 'bc00e484-d0e5-4da4-9472-95568cccc07e' as given in the golden answer. The submitted answer provided a list of other AAD device IDs, which are not relevant to the question asked.

Analysis: The key content required by the question is the specific AAD device ID 'bc00e484-d0e5-4da4-9472-95568cccc07e' where the attempt to access the Primary Refresh Token (PRT) was detected. The submitted answer does not include this key content and instead provides unrelated AAD device IDs, which makes it incorrect.

Is_Answer_Correct: False

Submitted Answer e5799261-6720-4297-961e-bd9ca4275033
Correct Answer bc00e484-d0e5-4da4-9472-95568cccc07e
Evaluation Analysis: The submitted answer does not match the golden answer and they are unique identifiers, so the answer must be exact.
Is_Answer_Correct: False
Reflection on Explanation Reflection: The previous evaluation correctly identified that the AadDeviceId is a unique identifier and must match exactly. There was no mistake in the prior evaluation.

Analysis: As the AadDeviceId provided in the submitted answer does not match the golden answer exactly, it is incorrect.

Is_Answer_Correct: False
question 105-159 | reward: 1 -> 0.4
Submitted Answer The files involved in the ransomware activity on the host `vnevado-win11t` include: 
1. `chylocaulous.zip.lockbit`
2. `feldspars.xls.lockbit.lockbit`
3. `azinphosmethyl.xlsx.lockbit`
Correct Answer get-userprttoken.ps1
Evaluation Analysis: The submitted answer fails to include the golden answer "get-userprttoken.ps1" and lists unrelated files, which lacks the necessary key information.
Is_Answer_Correct: False
Reflection on Explanation Reflection: The previous evaluation accurately noted that the submitted answer did not include the key information in the golden answer, which is "get-userprttoken.ps1". The provided list of files is entirely different and fails to identify the correct file associated with the ransomware activity.

Analysis: After reviewing the information again, it's evident that the submitted answer does not mention "get-userprttoken.ps1" at all. Instead, it lists different files that do not match the required key information about the script involved in the ransomware activity.

Is_Answer_Correct: False
question 135-98 | reward: 1 -> 0
Submitted Answer vnevado-win10s, vnevado-win10r, vnevado-win11t, vnevado-win11u
Correct Answer vnevado-win10s
Evaluation Analysis: The submitted answer includes the golden answer (`vnevado-win10s`) along with additional hostnames providing relevant context, which can be useful for the investigation.
Is_Answer_Correct: True
Reflection on Explanation Reflection: The previous evaluation correctly identified that the submitted answer contains the golden answer along with additional relevant context. However, we need to determine if the additional information provided is indeed relevant and does not cause confusion. 

Analysis: The question asks for the specific host name where 'CommandAndControl' malware was detected during lateral movement. The golden answer is `vnevado-win10s`. The submitted answer includes `vnevado-win10s` along with `vnevado-win10r`, `vnevado-win11t`, and `vnevado-win11u`. While it could be argued that additional context can sometimes be useful, in this case, it dilutes the precise information required which could cause confusion in pinpointing the exact host.

Is_Answer_Correct: False
question 103-113 | reward: 0 -> 0.56
Submitted Answer vnevado-win10v.vnevado.alpineskihouse.co
Correct Answer vnevado-win10s
Evaluation Analysis: The submitted answer contains the core hostname "vnevado-win10" but with additional domain-specific information. However, the unique identifier part "s" is replaced by "v", which makes it incorrect.
Is_Answer_Correct: False
Reflection on Explanation Reflection: The previous evaluation correctly identified that the unique identifier "s" in the hostname "vnevado-win10s" is crucial and was replaced by "v" in the submitted answer, making it incorrect.

Analysis: The key aspect of the hostname "vnevado-win10s" is indeed the specific identifier "s". The submitted answer "vnevado-win10v.vnevado.alpineskihouse.co" instead has an identifier "v", which is different from "s". This change in the unique identifier makes the submitted answer incorrect as it designates a different device.

Is_Answer_Correct: False
question 82-147 | reward: 1 -> 0
Submitted Answer The impacted files by ransomware include: bissellia.doc.lockbit, auxohormone.xlsm.lockbit.lockbit, boggin.txt.lockbit, booting.lob.lockbit.lockbit, bosselation.txt.lockbit, buzzgloak.xlsx.lockbit, brackish.zip.lockbit.lockbit, and many others with the .lockbit extension.
Correct Answer unstreaming.xlsx.lockbit
Evaluation Analysis: The submitted answer includes multiple file names impacted by ransomware with the `.lockbit` extension, but does not include the specific file `unstreaming.xlsx.lockbit`.
Is_Answer_Correct: False
Reflection on Explanation Reflection: The initial evaluation correctly noted that the submitted answer did not include the specific file `unstreaming.xlsx.lockbit` mentioned in the golden answer. The extensive list provided in the submitted answer failed to match the key content exactly as required.

Analysis: While the submitted answer does provide additional context by listing multiple files impacted by ransomware, it does not include the specific file `unstreaming.xlsx.lockbit` which is named in the golden answer. This is critical because the question asks specifically for the name of the file impacted by ransomware.

Is_Answer_Correct: False
